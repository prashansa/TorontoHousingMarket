# Toronto Housing Market
## Why are houses so expensive in Toronto? 

There has been a lot of public debate recently about housing prices in Toronto. 

The cost of living is becoming unaffordable for many Torontonians and home ownership has become unfeasible for a growing percentage of the population. 

There have been lots of explanations offered and solutions presented from across the political spectrum, yet the data underlying many of these arguments seems surprisingly scarce and the arguments surprisingly non-quantitative. 

## The aim of this analysis is to 
1. Understand the most important cause of high prices
2. Suggest one or two policy proposals, based on the findings above, that are most likely to reduce housing prices by the largest magnitude. 

## Trends of Average Sale Price of houses in Toronto
Refer to dataset [Toronto Avg Sale Price](datasets/toronto-avgsales-avgsalesprice.csv) and [Toronto MLS House Price Index](datasets/MLS-HousePriceIndex-AllTypes-SeasonallyAdjusted-BenchmarkPrice.xlsx)

## Now, a quick google search on the factors that can affect housing prices are 
### 1. Real Income and Demographics
Intuitively, as people start earning more, they are able to afford buying homes instead of renting them. So we can look at median income of all household types, and how that has changed over the years. Refer to dataset [Toronto Median-Income](datasets/toronto-median-income.csv)

### 2. Cost and accessibility of mortgages
What is the mortage cost? What is the lending policy? Who gets to access a mortgage? 
For understanding lending policy, we will look at the lending rates and their trends over time. Refer to dataset [Canada Lending Rates](datasets/canada-lendingrates-2000to2020.xlsx)

### 3. Construction and Development costs
What is the land cost at which the house is built? Is it near facilities like subway? What is the cost of development, including taxes? 


### 4. Land availability and regulations

### 5. Stock: Supply and Demand
Is the supply in the market meeting the demands? Is there a difference in both? 
To understand supply, we will look at the number of newly constructed houses
To understand demand, we will look at population rise ([Population of Toronto](datasets/toronto-population.csv)),
