## Why are houses so expensive in Toronto? 

There has been a lot of public debate recently about housing prices in Toronto. 

The cost of living is becoming unaffordable for many Torontonians and home ownership has become unfeasible for a growing percentage of the population. 

There have been lots of explanations offered and solutions presented from across the political spectrum, yet the data underlying many of these arguments seems surprisingly scarce and the arguments surprisingly non-quantitative. 

## I will try to explore 
1. What is the most important cause of high prices? 
2. Suggest one or two policy proposals, based on the findings above, that are most likely to reduce housing prices by the largest magnitude. 


## Now, a quick google search on the factors that can affect housing prices are 
1. Real Income and Demographics
2. Cost and accessibility of mortgages
3. Construction and Development costs
4. Land availability and regulations
5. Location
6. Stock, Supply and Demand
